## Overview
ContractLens automates the reconciliation of vendor invoices by orchestrating UiPath bots through a web-accessible governance layer. The platform extracts invoice data, compares billed rates and quantities against approved contract terms, identifies discrepancies, and produces standardized compliance reports.

The solution is designed to complement existing financial and contract management systems by automating repetitive validation tasks while maintaining full traceability and audit readiness required in federal acquisition environments.
